# SportSphere : A Personalized Sports Companion

## Project Overview

The Personalized Sports Companion aims to provide a unified, intelligent platform delivering personalized sports news, real-time fixtures, skill-building tutorials, and localized facility recommendations. The project will integrate multiple data sources (APIs, web scraping), leverage advanced technologies (FastAPI, LangChain, OpenAI embeddings), and ensure seamless user experience through scalable infrastructure. Key deliverables include a multi-agent system for dynamic content retrieval, personalized dashboards tailored to user interests, and automated ETL pipelines for continuous updates
